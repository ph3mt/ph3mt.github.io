Hello! I’m Ph3mt, an Italian cybersecurity enthusiast and malware analyst, with a focus on Android devices.

This blog is where I share research and ideas on malware analysis, penetration testing, and cybersecurity challenges. I’m passionate about solving CTFs to sharpen my skills and exploring system vulnerabilities to improve security.

Beyond tech, I follow a straight-edge lifestyle, love punk hardcore, metal, and rap music, and cheer for AS Roma
