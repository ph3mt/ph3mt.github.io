# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome to my website! I’m an Italian cybersecurity enthusiast and a proud fan of AS Roma. I spend my time researching malware, especially on Android devices, diving into CTF challenges, and working on penetration testing projects. This site is a space where I share my passion for cybersecurity and my journey in exploring the digital world. Whether you're here to learn, connect, or just share ideas, I hope you’ll find something interesting. Forza Roma!
